# That's all about the project

I need you to go to: " http://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/aktier ", check off large cap (so you only include small- and mid-cap) and open each company site and open the link "Fact sheet (in English)", which I have also attached for you to see.

From this factsheet I need the following newest information collected into excel (see attached excel sheet under "Nøgletal"):

"Name of the company"

"Market cap" on the first page under Key Stats

"Ebit (newest year)" on the first page under Financials

"Last Price" on the second page

"Cash and cash equivalents (newest year)", "current debt" and "long term debt" on the second page under Financial Position

"The summation of the most recent Earnings Per Share" on the second page under Quarterly Results
